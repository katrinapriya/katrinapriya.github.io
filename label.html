                                Smart home devices are becoming increasingly popular in the US. These internet-connected devices range from smart thermostats and speakers to security cameras and voice-enabled assistants such as Amazon Echo and Google Home.

Unfortunately, the majority of these devices have very poor security and privacy features.  <b> My team and I wanted to bring security, privacy, and transparency to the smart home device experience. </b>
<br></p><br>
 <p class="e" id = "designtitle"> 
                       Research & Analysis</p>


 <p class="e" id = "subtitle">
 We conducted a total of <b>16 interviews </b>with smart home device users, experts, and stakeholders. Our interviews illustrated a gap between what experts were saying and what users were doing. We learned that most smart home devices do not have security by design; yet users don’t look into their device’s security vulnerabilities.<div p style="width:image width px; font-size:75%; text-align:center;"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/aff.png" alt="alternate text" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;" /> <p class="e">  We used affinity diagramming to extract common themes from our interviews.</p>
                       </div>
               </p>         

<p class="e" id = "subtitle">
 
We saw a lack of urgency for strong security and privacy measures from users, who often undervalue their data. This lack of urgency exists in device makers as well, as they're not being held accountable for their poor security standards. 
<br><br>
Smart home device users were focused on convenience and accessibility. It became clear to us that users will only care about cybersecurity if it's convenient and easily accessible. We reframed our project to solve the following question: 

<b>How might we make security and privacy accessible and essential to smart home device consumers? </b>
<br>
<br>
<br>

</p>
 <p class="e" id = "designtitle"> 
                       Ideation</p>
 <div style="width:image width px; font-size:75%; text-align:center;"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/idea.png" alt="alternate text" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;" /> <p class="e"> We brainstormed solutions and created clusters of common themes. Using those clusters, we converged to three solutions.</p>
                       </div>
                  
                       <p class="e" id = "subtitle">
 After further discussion, we felt that redesigning a smart home device could make the device less convenient as we replace features, which would lose it's usability. Meanwhile, our second option was dependent on the financial capabilities of smart home device companies and users, which reduces its accessibility. 
<br><br>
We chose to pursue the privacy & security label, as it provides the most transparency to consumers. <b>With this label, we hope to empower customers to evaluate privacy and security features before purchasing a smart home device.</b> 
<br><br>
The purchasing stage is the best time to increase cybersecurity awareness of users, as our interviews showed us that most users don’t want to be inconvenienced with security once they start using their device.

                        We made the following choices for our initial prototypes: <br></p>

                        1. <b>We researched aspects of privacy and security </b>that should concern users to develop the content of the label. <br>

                        2. <b>We added a QR code </b>that links to a webpage that explains concepts from the label that might be unknown to a user.  <br>

                        3. <b>We included emoji faces </b>to illustrate the level of caution a user should have with the device’s security features. This aims to help users with less knowledge of security, and those who just look at the label briefly.

                     After receiving user feedback, I made the following design changes:
                       <br>
                       <p class="a" id = "subtitle">
1. <b>I made the label smaller.</b> Once we had the physical prototype in our hands, we realized that the label was too big to be put on smaller device boxes. 
<br>
2. <b>I expanded the emojis to every row on the label</b>, instead of just the security section. Users found the emojis extremely useful, so I made sure to utilize it throughout the sticker. <br>
3. <b>I made the webpage more user-friendly </b>by combining the best assets of each of our designs. I designed the layout to be similar to a phone's Settings page, so that it feels familiar to users. I kept it clean and monochromatic to match the text of the label itself. </p>
