                               My team and I were passionate about facilitating collective impact for social good. We grew our idea through pitch competitions, startup incubators, mentorship, and more.  Even though this was one of my earlier projects, I included this in my portfolio because of the growth I've had since this project.  </p><p class="e" id = "subtitle" style="color:#D50000">I'd like to look back on our mistakes and discuss what we could've done differently.</p>
<br>
 <p class="e" id = "designtitle"> 
                       Research & Ideation</p>



 <p class="e" id = "subtitle">
We envisioned an app that would connect users to causes they care about. The leader of the project called it "a Tinder for social good," as you could swipe through opportunities for social good that interest you. 
  We wanted to learn more about the pain points of various groups to explore ways our app idea could be used. We conducted over <b>25 in-depth interviews </b>and received <b>100+ survey responses </b>from students, professionals, companies, nonprofits, and more. <br>
 <p class="e" id = "subtitle" style="color:#D50000">
Mistake 1:  We were a solution in search of a problem, so we had a solution in mind before identifying a real problem. This made it difficult to be flexible to new ideas, and biased our interview questions towards the app idea. The solution should've been crafted later.  </p><br><div p style="width:image width px; font-size:75%; text-align:center;"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/persona.png" alt="alternate text" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;" /> <p class="e">  Here are some of the insights we gained from the interviews and surveys. </p>
                       </div>
               </p>         <br>


<p class="e" id = "subtitle" >
  The general problem that we saw from the interviews was <b>a disconnect between skilled students & professionals, and under-resourced opportunities for social good.</b> 
<br><br>

After discussing the insights from our interviews and surveys, we diverged to 2 different concepts. 
<div p style="width:image width px; font-size:75%; text-align:center;"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/concepts.png" alt="alternate text" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;" /> <p class="e"> Concept 1 helps professionals and companies, while Concept 2 helps students. Both focus on interest and skill-based opportunities.  </p><br>
                       </div>

<p class="e" id = "subtitle">
 Our mentors suggested going with Concept 1 because it had the better business model. However, the majority of the team felt that Concept 2 aligned with our original vision. We eventually leaned towards Concept 2, but only after weeks of discussions.
 <p class="e" id = "subtitle" style="color:#D50000">
Mistake 2:  We took a lot of input early-on from professors, advisors, investors, and more. Looking back, this was a mistake since we should've focused more on developing our own insights before trying to incorporate everyone's input. Additionally, instead of inefficiently discussing the two concepts, we should've done rapid prototyping and tested both ideas out. </p>


</p>
<br>
 <p class="e" id = "designtitle"> 
                       Solution </p>
 <p class="e" id = "subtitle">
  We wanted our solution to have the following features: <br></p>
  <p class="a" id = "subtitle">
    <ul class='a'>
 <li> Ability to start your own social initiative so that anyone can create impactful change  </li>
 <li> Skill-based opportunities to make use of an individual's wide range of skills</li>
  <li> Education on social issues and changemaking techniques to lead effective change</li>
  <li> User-to-user interaction to foster a community of changemakers </li> </ul>
   </p>
    <p class="e" id = "subtitle" style="color:#D50000">
Mistake 3:  We chose our features by looking at existing solutions. We were stuck in the mindset of trying to make our solution unique in this way. We should've been more clear on the problem we wanted to solve, and created the best features for that problem.   </p>
   
                       <div style="width:image width px; font-size:75%; text-align:center;"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/comp.png" alt="alternate text" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;" /> <p class="e">We performed a competitive analysis to illustrate our unique features.</p>


                       
                                          <p class="e" id = "subtitle"><br>

                     We had early sketches that we based our final prototype on, but I don't have them documented. We only showed our final prototype to students and mentors for feedback. 
  <p class="e" id = "subtitle" style="color:#D50000">
Mistake 4:  We should've showed lower fidelity prototypes to users for more honest, detailed feedback that we could quickly iterate from. </p>
                   
</div><br>

   <div style="width:image width px; font-size:75%; text-align:center;"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/impp.png" alt="alternate text" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;" /> <p class="e">I created this hi-fidelity prototype of our envisioned app. You can interact with <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/SlKHaybvotTV7yUKDZXG4N/impactify?node-id=5%3A9&scaling=scale-down"style="color:blue"target="_blank">the prototype here.</a></p></div>

     
<p class="e" id = "subtitle"><br>
  When signing up, users are asked to indicate the social causes they care about and their skills. Once on the app, they can explore educational content, tasks posted by individuals & organizations, local events, and ideas for social initiatives.

 Each post is color-coded by the type of post it is. Users can swipe left or right on the posts to indicate their interest level. You can explore the post by clicking on it. 
</p>
  <p class="e" id = "subtitle" style="color:#D50000">
Mistake 5:  We incorporated far too many features for our first prototype. I wish we had kept it more simple.    </p>
<p class="e" id = "subtitle">
I ended up leaving this project after developing this prototype for it. However, after becoming a finalist in the global Big Ideas' Social Innovation contest, a team in Europe has continued to work on it!
