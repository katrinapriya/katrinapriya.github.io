                        CHALLENGE<br>
We discovered that people want to get involved in their communities and work on social issues that they care about, yet they have difficulty efficiently finding social impact projects that align with their skills & interests. 
<br>
<br>
CONTEXT <br>
I worked on this idea in a team of 6 in my Social Entrepreneurship class. The leader of this project and I extended it outside of the class to apply to accelerators, pitch competitions, and more. We grew our team and had mentors from Berkeley StEP, AccelerateHer, Big Ideas, and more. 
<br>
<br>
RESEARCH
<br>
From our user interviews, we saw a need for this problem to be solved among:
<br>1. Young professionals who want to make an impact with their free time outside of work 
<br>2. Students (middle school to college aged) who are passionate about social issues 
<br>3. Companies and organizations who want to improve culture and fulfill corporate social responsibility needs
</p>
                                  <img class="img-fluid" src="img/persona.png">
<br>
<br>  <p class = "modaltext"> OUR SOLUTION <br> I developed a mockup on Figma of our envisioned app. It allows users to easily swipe through social impact opportunities. It focuses on creating a community of changemakers -- where anyone can learn the skills needed to turn their ideas into action and anyone can post their initiatives and collaborate with others interested in similar social issues.

In a large organization like Cisco, it can be difficult to form meaningful relationships with coworkers. Furthermore, interns and early career professionals struggle to integrate seamlessly into the social scene.
<br>
<br>
CONTEXT <br>
During my internship at Cisco, I took on this challenge as a fun side project. I initially pitched it at the Cisco CollabHacks hackathon with a team of interns. After the hackathon, I continued to work on it myself.  
<br> <br>
RESEARCH <br>
Since this was pitched during a two-day hackathon, we weren’t able to do much user research. However, we did find a lot of data and online articles related to this problem that confirmed our hypotheses. 
 <br><br>
OUR SOLUTION <br>
I designed a bot for Cisco Webex Teams that randomly groups people from the space in which the bot is called together. It encourages social interaction between different business units and roles, as well as being a tool for networking and mentorship. Teams within companies can use the bot to foster team culture and spirit. <br><br>I included fun features to solve the awkwardness of meeting strangers. There are icebreakers, cuisine recommendations and jokes! I self-taught myself everything that I needed to build the bot. My bot is available on WebEx Teams today, and my coworkers actually still use it!

According to the Department of Transportation, airlines loose 10% of luggage. Losing luggage not only leads to a bad experience for passengers, but it also costs airline company $900 million a year for insurance. Almost every person we interviewed had a story of their bags being lost or delayed. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        CONTEXT <br>
                        I worked on this idea for my product design class in a team of 6 students primarily from business backgrounds. We developed this product throughout the semester and conducted a lot of user research. At the end of the semester, our product was featured at a showcase at Jacobs Hall.

                          We designed an electronic bag tag gets rid of those long sticky paper tags we print at airports for checked-in luggage. The tag would contain an RFID chip so that it can be tracked after the flight. This would reduce lost luggage at airports. We also hope to implement an alert on a phone app for when the bag arrives at baggage claim. I developed the mockups of the app interface, as well as the logo.
