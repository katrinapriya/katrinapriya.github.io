                                When I want to something with friends, I'm not sure who to contact because I don't know who's available or interested. 
 Long-term planning doesn't always work out, since people back out last minute. Ever since I realized that this problem often limits my social interactions, I became determined to find a solution.

                       Research & Analysis</p>


 <p class="e" id = "subtitle">
  I wanted to see if others faced this problem, and to what extent. I <b>interviewed 10 young adults</b> to learn about their frustrations when wanting to something with friends. I listened to their stories and how they currently go about dealing with their difficulties. I also <b>conducted research on Reddit and Twitter</b> to learn more about what people think and feel about this issue. I did this by searching relevant keywords and phrases.
  <br><br>
<div p style="width:image width px; font-size:75%; text-align:center;"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/notes.png" alt="alternate text" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;" /> <p class="e">  I used affinity diagramming to cluster observations from interviews & research into insights. </p>

<p class="e" id = "subtitle">
Here are some of the insights I gathered:
<ul class = "a">
<li> <b>Planning activities with friends requires a lot of effort and time.</b> It's difficult to commit to a time that works for everyone. It can be hard to initiate, especially in group settings, when people are worried about getting ghosted, being judged, or are lazy and reluctant about planning the logistics. 
</li>
<br> <li><b>Availability of friends is important, but often unknown.</b> There's no way to actually know who's available without messaging them first. An interviewee shared with me that she has to "message multiple group chats & friends hoping that SOMEONE will respond" in order to do an activity with friends. Slow communication can really limit action between friends, especially when there's a time constraint. </li>
<br><li> <b>These issues are heightened and more urgent during the COVID-19 pandemic</b>. With fewer in-person interactions, there is less knowledge of friends' availabilities. However, this is a time to encourage checking in on friends, as people are feeling a greater lack of motivation and accountability for social interactions. The pandemic has also led to increased loneliness and isolation. 
</li>
</ul>
<p class="e" id = "subtitle">

<b>Each of my interviewees had unique experiences with this topic.</b> Some rarely face the insights that I listed above, while others feel this way all the time. When narrowing down the scope of my problem, I focused on pain points that I also could identify with, since I originally was designing this to solve a personal problem. <br></p></p><br>

                       Prototyping</p>
                       <p class="e" id = "subtitle">
                     I have some iOS app development experience, so I felt comfortable coming up with an app idea to resolve some of the frustrations I had and learned about.


<br><br>

                       However, I was concerned about contributing to the rise of cell phone usage in young adults, which has been shown to negatively affect mental health. For this reason, I wanted to make an app that <b>encourages action towards real social interactions.</b> I hope to do this by making the functions of the app very straightforward, and create features that let you spend less time on your phone planning and messaging. 

                       <br>

                  <div style="width:image width px; font-size:75%; text-align:center;"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/mid.png" alt="alternate text" width="width" height="height" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;" /> <p class="e"> I developed the sketches into mid-fidelity wireframes focused on layout.  <br><br></p>
                       </div>
                       <p class="e" id = "subtitle">
                        <b>Throughout the prototyping process, I asked potential users for feedback.</b>
With their help, I designed an app that allows you to post what you feel like doing, along with a time frame, to who you want to do that with.  I included the following features to make spontaneous meetups easier: <br><ul class = "a">

	<li> <b>A feed that lets you browse through what your friends are up to.</b> Joining an activity just takes one click of a button. Creating a post is just as simple. I wanted as few steps as possible to make this app efficient and to-the-point.
</li> <br>
                       	<li><b>The ability to indicate whether or not you are available to do something with friends.</b> If you are available, you will get notified of friends’ posts; otherwise, you won’t be bothered. This addresses the point of not knowing friends' availabilities & messaging people who are busy. </li>
<br>
                      <li> 	<b>A feature that lets you make groups and get notified when your whole group is available.</b> Many young adults complained about planning activities with groups, as it can be time-consuming and difficult to plan around everyone's schedules. </li><br>

                  I created my final design on Figma using modern, sans-serif fonts, and a simple, playful color scheme. I drew my visual design inspiration from popular social media apps today, which are <b>minimalistic and clean</b>. Each element in the interface was thoughtfully chosen, as I only kept elements that added value and meaning to the overall design.

                   <br><br> My interviews suggested that sometimes people don’t know what to do with friends, so I added a few <b>suggestions for what to do.</b> While social distancing rules are in place, the app can provide suggestions such as remote Netflix parties, video calls, virtual games, and more.

                     I watched users interact with the prototype and listened to whether it solves their frustrations. In terms of usability, they found it to be easy-to-use and intuitive. </p>  <br>

                        <p class="e" id = "subtitle">
                     <br>I also got some comments that sparked new questions and ideas for this app. For example, some users had concerns about how they'd plan out details after joining an activity. 
                     I'd like to implement a poll feature and a restaurant picker that incorporates each group member’s preferences to speed up additional planning. This would be included in the group chat that you get added to after joining an activity.

                    After another design iteration where I address such concerns, <b>I plan on beginning to code and develop the actual app.</b> <br>

                                <li> Don't ask users to design features; instead, listen to their pain points and see if you can address them.
                                <li> Working on a side project alone often left me feeling unmotivated - it's important to set goals regularly to give structure. </li> 
                                <li> It helps to write down your values and vision for an idea, so that you can reference it while making design decisions. This is especially important when you have contradictory interview or research data. </li>
                                <li> Start simple - there's no need to address every single frustration of every potential user. </li> 
                                <li> Not everyone will use your product, so focus your energy on the people you're designing for. </li>
